# 1. Create three new variables related to our congress dataset: (a) the age of the member, (b) the number of committees they are on, 
# and (c) the percentage of instances where they hold a title in the committees they belong to (i.e. when the title entry in the committee membership dataframe is not empty). 
# You will want to save these new variables for future problems. Then use the summary function to create summary statistics for these new variables.
